# Python Technology Template Repository

A comprehensive Python template repository following best practices for software development. This template includes integrated testing, static analysis, code formatting, and CI/CD pipelines.

## Features

- **Complete Project Structure**: Well-organized directory structure for maintainability and scalability
- **Component-Based Architecture**: Modular components with clear interfaces
- **Testing Suite**: Unit, integration, and end-to-end tests with pytest
- **Static Analysis**: Type checking with mypy and linting with ruff
- **Dependency Management**: Modern package management with UV
- **CI/CD**: Continuous integration with CircleCI
- **Code Coverage**: Test coverage tracking and reporting

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- UV package manager

### Installation

1. Install UV (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

2. Clone this template:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/python-template-repository.git
   cd python-template-repository

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash 
    sync


Components
This template includes three example components:

1. Calculator: Performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
2. Logger: Records operations and their results with configurable output formats
3. Notifier: Sends alerts when values exceed user-defined thresholds

# Using Components

### Example usage of the components
## Python Example
from calculator.src.calculator import Calculator
from logger.src.logger import Logger
from notifier.src.notifier import Notifier

### Create a calculator
calc = Calculator()
result = calc.add(5, 3)  # Returns 8

### Log the operation
logger = Logger()
logger.log_operation("Addition", [5, 3], result)

### Set up notification
notifier = Notifier(threshold=10)
notifier.check_value(result)  # No notification (8 < 10)
result = calc.multiply(5, 3)  # Returns 15
notifier.check_value(result)  # Sends notification (15 > 10)
For detailed information about the component architecture, see component.md.
Testing
Running Tests
Run all tests:
bashCopyuv run pytest
Run a specific component's unit tests:
bashCopyuv run pytest calculator/src/calculator/tests/
Run integration tests:
bashCopyuv run pytest tests/integration/
Run end-to-end tests:
bashCopyuv run pytest tests/e2e/
Run tests with coverage:
bashCopyuv run pytest --cov
Test Structure

Unit Tests: Located alongside each component to test individual functionality

Calculator tests verify addition, subtraction, and multiplication operations
Logger tests ensure operations are logged correctly
Notifier tests confirm notifications are sent when thresholds are exceeded


Integration Tests: Located in tests/integration/ to test component interactions

Calculator → Logger integration (with mocked Notifier)
Logger → Notifier integration (with mocked Calculator)


End-to-End Tests: Located in tests/e2e/ to test complete workflows

Full workflow test: calculation → logging → notification



Code Quality
Static Analysis
Run linting with Ruff:
bashCopyuv run ruff check .
Run type checking with MyPy:
bashCopyuv run mypy calculator logger notifier tests
Configuration
This template uses strict settings for code quality:

MyPy: Strict type checking enabled with all checks
Ruff: Comprehensive linting rules enabled

Any disabled checks are documented with explanations in the pyproject.toml file.
CI/CD Pipeline
This template is configured with CircleCI for continuous integration. The pipeline:

Installs dependencies with UV
Runs linting with ruff
Runs type checking with mypy
Runs all tests with pytest
Generates code coverage reports
Stores test results for viewing in the CircleCI dashboard

CI/CD Links

GitHub Templates
This repository includes templates to standardize:

Pull Requests: Structured format for code changes
Bug Reports: Detailed information for reporting issues
Feature Requests: Format for suggesting enhancements

Customizing This Template
To use this template for your own project:

Update package information in the root pyproject.toml
